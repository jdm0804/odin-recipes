                <li> ½ teaspoon salt</li>
                
                <li>1 ½ cups white sugar</li>
                
                <li>½ cup butter, softened</li>
                
                <li>1 cup canned pumpkin puree</li>
                
                <li>1 large egg</li>
                
                <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>

        </ul>

        <p>You thought I was done? We still have the icing to make!</p>

    <p>That's right, fucker; buckle up!</p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups confectioners' sugar</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons milk</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon melted butter</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two cookie sheets. Or put some parchment paper down.</li>
        <li>Get your favorite mixing bowl. Combine flour, cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda, nutmeg, cloves, and salt in said bowl.</li>
        <li>Cream together sugar and butter in a mixing bowl until fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes. Add pumpkin, egg, and vanilla; beat until creamy. Mix in flour mixture until combined. Drop tablespoonfuls of dough onto the prepared cookie sheets; flatten slightly.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until centers are set, 15 to 20 minutes, switching racks halfway through. Transfer cookies to a wire rack to cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes. Resist the urge to eat them too early.</li>
        <li>Distract yourself from the overwhelming impulse to just eat them like little spice cakes by making the icing. Grab your second favorite mixing bowl.</li>
        <li>Melt the butter in the bowl.Use the microwave for like 20-30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Combine the confectioners sugar, milk, vanilla, and butter.</li>
        <li>Take a second to giggle to yourself because this icing looks like something else. Then get your mind out of the gutter, pervert.</li>
        <li>Do the courteous thing and put a towel down under the cookies.</li>
        <li>Bukkake the cookies with the icing.</li>
        <li>NOW eat the best fucking fall cookies you'll ever eat in your life.</li>
    </ol>
