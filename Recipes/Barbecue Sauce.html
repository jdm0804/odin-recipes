        <h2>The perfect condiment</h2>
        <p>This barbecue sauce will convince even the most flavor-skeptical among us to love things that have taste.</p>
        <p>Before I realized what "toxic masculinity" was, I was under the impression that "manliness" was a list of things men all needed. On that list were things like "All men need to grow a beard" and "Men like utilitiarian decor."</p>
        <p>The whole list was stupid, childish, and immature. Like toxic masculinity!</p>
        <p>There was one exception: I believed then, and continue to believe that everyone needs to have a special recipe. Something to break out at parties to get people talking. This is mine.</p>
        <p>I developed this recipe because I noticed that there are basically 3 types of barbecue sauce available at the store: Smoky, Honey, and Whiskey. But I like all three. So this recipe has all three!</p>
        <ul>What do you need to make this incredible condiment?
                <li>1/2 cup Worcestershire sauce (Wash-your-sister sauce)</li>

                <li>1/2 cup water</li>
                
                <li>A splash of soy sauce</li>
                
                <li>1 tablespoon honey</li>
                
                <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
                
                <li>1/2 small can tomato paste</li>
                
                <li> a pinch of salt</li>
                
                <li>1 tablespoon garlic (rounded. There is no such thing as "too much")</li>
                
                <li>1/2 tsp onion powder (or 1/2 a small onion)</li>
                
                <li>a dash of cayenne pepper</li>
                
                <li>a dash of mustard powder</li>
                
                <li>1/2 shot of whiskey (or 1 shot if you're not a coward)</li>

                <li>a pinch of pepper</li>

                <li>a splash of liquid smoke</li>

        </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Grab a pot</li>
        <li>Put all of the ingredients into the pot, except for the tomato paste. Wait a bit for that one.</li>
        <li>Bring the savory concoction to a simmer for about 10-15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the tomato paste to thicken.</li>
        <li>Now slather it on some chicken or make some sloppy joes.  I don't care what you do next, I'm not your dad.</li>
    </ol>
