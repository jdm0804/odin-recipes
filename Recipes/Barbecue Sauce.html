        <h2>The perfect condiment</h2>
        <p>This barbecue sauce will convince even the most flavor-skeptical among us to love spice.</p>
        <p>Before I realized what "toxic masculinity" was, I was under the impression that "manliness" was a list of things men all needed. On that list were things like "All men need to grow a beard" and "Men like utilitiarian decor."</p>
        <p>The whole list was stupid, childish, and immature. Like toxic masculinity!</p>
        <p>There was one exception: I believed then, and continue to believe that everyone needs to have a special recipe. Something to break out at parties to get people talking. This is mine.</p>
        <p>I developed this recipe because I noticed that there are basically 3 types of barbecue sauce available at the store: Smoky, Honey, and Whiskey. But I like all three. So this recipe has all three!</p>
        <ul>What do you need to make this incredible condiment?
                <li>1/2 cup Worcestershire sauce (Wash-your-sister sauce)</li>

                <li>1/2 cup water</li>
                
                <li>A splash of soy sauce</li>
                
                <li>1 tablespoon honey</li>
                
                <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
                
                <li>1/2 small can tomato paste</li>
                
                <li> a pinch of salt</li>
                
                <li>1 tablespoon garlic (rounded. There is no such thing as "too much")</li>
                
                <li>1/2 tsp onion powder (or 1/2 a small onion)</li>
                
                <li>a dash of cayenne pepper</li>
                
                <li>a dash of mustard powder</li>
                
                <li>1/2 shot of whiskey (or 1 shot if you're not a coward)</li>

                <li>a pinch of pepper</li>

                <li>a splash of liquid smoke</li>

        </ul>

        <p>You thought I was done? We still have the icing to make!</p>

    <p>That's right, fucker; buckle up!</p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups confectioners' sugar</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons milk</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon melted butter</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two cookie sheets. Or put some parchment paper down.</li>
        <li>Get your favorite mixing bowl. Combine flour, cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda, nutmeg, cloves, and salt in said bowl.</li>
        <li>Cream together sugar and butter in a mixing bowl until fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes. Add pumpkin, egg, and vanilla; beat until creamy. Mix in flour mixture until combined. Drop tablespoonfuls of dough onto the prepared cookie sheets; flatten slightly.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until centers are set, 15 to 20 minutes, switching racks halfway through. Transfer cookies to a wire rack to cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes. Resist the urge to eat them too early.</li>
        <li>Distract yourself from the overwhelming impulse to just eat them like little spice cakes by making the icing. Grab your second favorite mixing bowl.</li>
        <li>Melt the butter in the bowl.Use the microwave for like 20-30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Combine the confectioners sugar, milk, vanilla, and butter.</li>
        <li>Take a second to giggle to yourself because this icing looks like something else. Then get your mind out of the gutter, pervert.</li>
        <li>Do the courteous thing and put a towel down under the cookies.</li>
        <li>Bukkake the cookies with the icing.</li>
        <li>NOW eat the best fucking fall cookies you'll ever eat in your life.</li>
    </ol>
